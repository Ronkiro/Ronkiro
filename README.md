I'm a Fullstack Developer/Computer Engineering student that loves coding. I code since i was 7yo, and that's my true passion. My first language was Lua, but now my stack is totally different.

I currently work for 3CON as a .NET/Angular developer. But i also do works on open-source, either by just replying the community, helping with it's organization or by really coding in practice.

My current focus on learning is DevOps and cloud environments, but i'm always looking into improving myself on what i already know.
